# Quick Start: Team Stats Aggregation

## TL;DR

To update all team stats from PlayerDay records:

```bash
npm run team:update-all
```

That's it! This will:

1. Aggregate PlayerDays → TeamDays (by date)
2. Aggregate TeamDays → TeamWeeks (by week)
3. Aggregate TeamWeeks → TeamSeasons (by season)
4. Update Matchup scores

## Common Workflows

### After Yahoo Scraper

```bash
# Complete post-scrape workflow
npm run ranking:update-all  # 1. Update player ratings
npm run lineup:update-all   # 2. Optimize lineups
npm run team:update-all     # 3. Aggregate team stats
```

### Update Specific Season

```bash
npm run team:update-all -- --season=7
```

### Update Specific Week

```bash
npm run team:update-all -- --week=7-15
```

### Preview Changes (Dry Run)

```bash
npm run team:update-all -- --dry-run
```

## Performance

| Operation                  | Time    |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Single week (all 3 levels) | ~0.8s   |
| Full season (23 weeks)     | ~18-25s |
| Per team-day               | ~10ms   |

**Safe to run multiple times** - uses upsert logic (create if new, update if exists)

## Troubleshooting

**"No week found"**: Check `Week` table in Sheets - ensure dates are correct

**"Quota exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes, the script has automatic retry logic

**"Matchup not found"**: Ensure `Matchup` records exist for the week

**TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run typecheck` to see full error details
